# Vernier

Experimental next-generation Ruby profiler.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'vernier'
```

## Usage

### Retained memory

Record a flamegraph of all **retained** allocations from loading `irb`.

```
ruby -r vernier -e 'Vernier.trace_retained(out: "irb_profile.json") { require "irb" }'
```

The output can then be viewed in the [Firefox Profiler (demo)](https://share.firefox.dev/3DhLsFa)

### Time

```
Vernier.trace(out: "time_profile.json") { some_slow_method }'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
